# Hello-world
Coming back to coding after a long time. Based in Canada. Looking for starting my career. 
Started with C to build a tic tac toe game in 2009, without a GUI.
2020 learnt Andriod studio (Java) and built a finance app with a mortgage calculator. The app landing page has a seekbar to recommend next pages to visit to the user based upon their input age on seekbar. Hoping to add some API and database connection, but i keep getting a class not found exception.
